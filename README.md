[Dadaab refugee complex](https://www.unhcr.org/ke/dadaab-refugee-complex). is located in kenya and it houses almost 300,000 refugees from Somalia under the protection of UNHCR and the Government of Kenya. half of the refugees are youth and most of them are not exposed to high-level digital skills.

The success of the project will ensure they have access to these skills to leverage their problem solving skills and their economic status.It will also be a way to instill development in the young generation and to protect them from engaging social vices.
